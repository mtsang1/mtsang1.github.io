Garlic comes from a species in the onion genus called Allium. It is native to Central Asia and northeastern Iran. Today, China produces 80% of the worldâ€™s garlic supply. Garlic can be grown by planting the individual cloves in the ground. When choosing to select the garlic to harvest, workers look for those with large bulbs and carefully dig them up with a spade. They are hung upside down on a string for 3-4 weeks to cure in a dark, cool place. The bulb is the most commonly used part of the plant since the gloves are used for cooking. Other parts of the garlic plant like the leaves and flowers are also edible and sometimes eaten.
