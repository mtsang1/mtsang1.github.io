Ginger comes from the roots of the ginger plant called Zingiber officinale and originated from Island Southeast Asia.  It’s the result of artificial selection among the Austronesian peoples. It has the ability to grow in a variety of environmental conditions, however, it’s best grown in warm, humid environments. Most of the ginger comes from India, Nigeria, and China today.  They are harvested at full maturity from 8-10 months and then soaked overnight. Then the skin is gently scraped off; this process can’t be done by machinery because it’s too delicate of a process.
